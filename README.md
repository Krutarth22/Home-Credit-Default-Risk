# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

The aim of this project is to classify whether a customer of Home Credit will default on its loan or not based on various attributes of the customer as well as their history with other loans.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first notebook contains extensive EDA of the primary dataset along with the supporting datasets. The motive here is to find patterns and trends in a visual form which can aid in discerning the likelihood of the class.

# Feature Engineering and Paramter Tuning

The metric used here is ROC-AUC. To get the best results it is imperative to perform feature engineering. The datasets here offer a huge scope for feature engineering and is limited to one's imagination and creativity. The model used here is LGBM. It is demonstrated that parameter tuning plays a very vital role in achieving the best results. Bayesian Optimization technique is used for parameter tuning.
